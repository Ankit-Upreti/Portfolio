      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>As of now the only thing you know about me is my name and my profession (Not certainlyü•≤), but in this section
        you will come to know about me a lot, I am from Uttarakhand and I have done my schooling from Shiksha Bharati
        Senior Secondary School, Khatima. I am quite lazy guy who loves to do timepass most of the
        time(errrr.....jokingüòÜ). But actually i am a kind of guy who is much more passionate about what i am doing at
        that particular time. I am a dedicated kind of person towards my work. I love to play cricket, listening to
        music and in the name of anime, as it's the most popular thing than any specific degree among genZ
        people(sry...again jokingüòÇ) i love to watch pokemon since my childhood, i love to read books that include
        spiritual knowledge or certainly which have philoshiopical genre. To your knowledge I am a pro gamer also(..hope
        it would have been trueü•≤), i used to play free fire battle royal very far ago but now i am quite far from it. I
        am not in tech from very early so i don't know much more about tech rather than python, html, c, css,
        javascript. I decided to start my journey from web developement and here i am into it. A major skill in me
        include communication skill which can also be counted as my best soft-skill and another one is my leadership
